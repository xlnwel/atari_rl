In this project, we implement Rainbow and replace c51 in Rainbow with IQN.

## Algorithm Implemented

- [x] Rainbow
- [x] PER
- [x] Noisy Nets
- [x] Double
- [x] c51
- [x] Dueling nets
- [x] IQN

## Requirements

It is recommended to install Tensorflow from source following [this instruction](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source) to gain some CPU boost and other potential benefits.

```shell
# Minimal requirements to run the algorithms. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2, using Tensorflow 1.13.1.
# Forget the deprecated warnings... This project is not designed according to Tensorflow 2.X
conda create -n gym python
conda activate gym
pip install -r requirements.txt
# install gym atari
pip install 'gym[atari]'
# Install tensorflow-gpu or install it from scratch as the above instruction suggests
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

## Running

```shell
# Silence tensorflow debug message
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3

# When running distributed algorithms, restrict numpy to one core
# Use numpy.__config__.show() to ensure your numpy is using OpenBlas
# For MKL and detailed reasoning, refer to [this instruction](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example-rl-pong.html?highlight=openblas#the-distributed-version)
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1

# By default, this line runs rainbow-iqn, which replaces c51 in rainbow with iqn
# For full argument specification, please refer to run/train.py
python run/train.py
```

## Details

All tests are done in [PongNoFrameskip-v4](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/), 

1. Double Q nets, noisy layers, PER, multi-steps are used by default. 

2. Best arguments are kept in `args.yaml`. Most arguments are from the reference paper, learning rate schedule is from homework3 of UCB [cs285](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

3. I modify the network a little bit, by adding a dense layer before dueling heads. This saves more than 2/3 parameters(10 million vs 36 million, which is mainly induced by the combination of dueling heads and noisy layers). Furthermore, it mitigates overfitting on some environments such as breakout.
