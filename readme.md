In this project, we implement Rainbow and replace c51 in Rainbow with IQN.

## Algorithm Implemented

- [x] Rainbow
- [x] PER
- [x] Noisy Nets
- [x] Double
- [x] c51
- [x] Dueling nets
- [x] IQN

## Results

Basically all arguments are from reference papers, I did not take much time to fine-tune these arguments, since it takes too long to run a trial on atari.

## Requirements

It is recommended to install Tensorflow from source following [this instruction](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source) to gain some CPU boost and other potential benefits.

```shell
# Minimal requirements to run the algorithms. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2, using Tensorflow 1.13.1.
# Forget the deprecated warnings... This project is not designed according to Tensorflow 2.X
conda create -n gym python
conda activate gym
pip install -r requirements.txt
# install gym atari
pip install 'gym[atari]'
# Install tensorflow-gpu or install it from scratch as the above instruction suggests
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

## Running

```shell
# Silence tensorflow debug message
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3

# When running distributed algorithms, restrict numpy to one core
# Use numpy.__config__.show() to ensure your numpy is using OpenBlas
# For MKL and detailed reasoning, refer to [this instruction](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example-rl-pong.html?highlight=openblas#the-distributed-version)
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1

# By default, this line runs rainbow-iqn, which replaces c51 in rainbow with iqn
# For full argument specification, please refer to run/train.py
python run/train.py
```

## Details

All tests are done in PongNoFrameskip-v4 and BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4, 

1. Double Q nets, noisy layers, PER, multi-steps are used by default. 

2. Best arguments are kept in `args.yaml`; most arguments come from the rainbow.

3. Unlike the official implementation, we apply layer normalization to dense layers, instance normalization to conv layers. Tehse could be designated by `conv_norm` and `dense_norm` in `algo/rainbow_iqn/args.yaml`
